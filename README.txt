This is a practice project for making a basic todo list as outlined on the Practical JavaScript course of watchandcode.com.

<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* GIVEN SPECS *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
To Do List web app should have:
1) a place to store todo items
2) a way to display todo items
3) a way to add new todo items
4) a way to change existing todo items
5) a way to delete todos

<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* MY USER STORIES *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
1) As a busy executive, I can access a todo list to add, change, delete, and cross items off my list.
2) As an even busier executive, I can tab through different menus to show ALL todos, INCOMPLETE todos, and FINISHED todos.
3) As a carbon-based life-form, I can select todos in batches for deletion.
